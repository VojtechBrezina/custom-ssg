# List parsing

## Mixed unordered marks

Unordered lists can have mixed syntax, because I cannot be bothered:

```
* one
- two
* three
```

* one
- two
* three

## Nested lists

The original project description assumes a flat list. This version does not.

```
* First level
    * Second level
        * Third level
        * Some item
    * Back to second
* Back to first
```

* First level
    * Second level
        * Third level
        * Some item
    * Back to second
* Back to first
